At time of submission this file wouldn't load the game due to a NullPointerException Error,
I was not able to fix this before I had to submit so I was unable to provide a video






Assignment 3

- My Solar System model, the names of planets appear when you hover on them, there's background music
- It works on eclipse, but i did the video in processing IDE because i was having trouble getting the video software to work(that's also why this is a little later than 4pm), language is processing
